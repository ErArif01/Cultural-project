Preservation studies encompass a multidisciplinary field focused on the conservation, protection, and management of cultural heritage, artifacts, historical sites, and materials for future generations. It involves a range of practices aimed at safeguard
and maintaining the physical, historical, and cultural integrity of objects and sites. Here are key aspects and components of preservation studies : 

1. Conservation and restoration : preservation studies involve the conservation and restoration of artwoks, archaeological finds, historical buildings, documents, manuscripts, and other cultural artifacts. Conservation aims to stablize and prevent
further deterioration of cultural materials, while restoration involves repairing or reconstructing damaged objects to their original state, if possible.

2. Preventive conservation : This aspect focused on preventive measures to mitigate deterioration and damage. It includes environmental controls, proper storage, handling procedures, pest control, and monitoring to ensure the long-term preservation
of artifacts and sites.

3. Material science and analysis : Preservation studies often integrate scientific methods and analysis to understand the composition, degradation, and aging of materials. Techniques such as spectroscopy, microscopy, and chemical analysis aid in 
identifying materials and determining suitable conservation approaches.
